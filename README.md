# 📊 Bank Customer Data Analysis (EDA Project)

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of bank customer data to uncover meaningful insights into **customer behavior, financial standing, and risk profiles**. The analysis examines how factors such as **income, loyalty classification, age, property ownership, and risk weighting** influence key financial metrics.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate **data-driven insights**, strong **analytical thinking**, and effective **visual storytelling**, making it suitable for academic evaluation as well as a professional data analysis portfolio.

## 🧾 Dataset Description

The dataset contains anonymized banking customer information, including:

* Loyalty Classification (Jade, Silver, Gold, Platinum)
* Income Bands (Low, Mid, High)
* Age
* Estimated Income
* Bank Deposits
* Bank Loans
* Credit Card Balance
* Superannuation Savings
* Property Ownership
* Risk Weighting (1–5)

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives

* Segment customers based on **loyalty and income**
* Identify **primary drivers of financial behavior**
* Analyze the effect of **age and life stage** on financial metrics
* Compare **property owners vs non-owners**
* Study the relationship between **risk appetite and financial exposure**

---

## 📌 Key Findings & Insights

### 1️⃣ Customer Segmentation by Loyalty & Income

* **Jade** and **Silver** loyalty tiers form the **largest customer base**, especially within the **Mid income band**.
* Example: *Jade – Mid Income* segment includes **689 customers**.
* **Platinum** loyalty customers are consistently the **smallest segment** across all income bands.

➡️ *Insight:* Loyalty classification affects distribution, but not necessarily financial strength.

---

### 2️⃣ Income as the Primary Financial Driver

* Financial metrics such as **Estimated Income, Bank Deposits, and Bank Loans** increase consistently with higher **Income Bands**.
* This trend remains stable across all loyalty classifications.

➡️ *Conclusion:* **Income Band is a stronger determinant of financial behavior than loyalty status**.

---

### 3️⃣ Age & Income Influence Financial Behavior

* Bank Deposits, Loans, and Credit Card Balances vary significantly across **age groups**.
* Different income bands show **distinct financial patterns**, reflecting life stages such as early career, peak earning years, and retirement.

➡️ *Insight:* Financial behavior evolves with **both age and income level**, not age alone.

---

### 4️⃣ Property Ownership & Financial Standing

* Property owners generally show:

  * Higher **Estimated Income**
  * Larger **Bank Loans**
  * Stronger **Superannuation Savings**
* Non-property owners tend to have lower overall financial exposure.

➡️ *Conclusion:* Property ownership is closely associated with higher financial commitments and long-term planning.

---

### 5️⃣ Risk Weighting & Financial Exposure

* A **strong positive correlation** exists between **Risk Weighting (1–5)** and financial metrics.

| Risk Weight | Avg Bank Loans | Avg Credit Card Balance | Avg Estimated Income |
| ----------- | -------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1           | ~$334k         | ~$1.8k                  | ~$77k                |
| 5           | ~$975k         | ~$5.3k                  | ~$310k               |

➡️ *Insight:* Higher-risk customers tend to manage **larger loans, higher income, and greater credit exposure**.
